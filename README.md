An intelligent, multi-modal smart cane for the visually impaired that combines emotional awareness with physical stability prediction. This system uses TinyML on ESP32 to not only navigate but also understand the user's state to prevent accidents before they happen.

**Core AI Modules:**
- 🧠 **Emotion & Facial Awareness:** Detects emotion, age, and gender for social interaction cues.
- 🚷 **Environment Perception:** Fuses vision and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle, landmark, and navigable gap detection.
- 🆘 **Emergency Voice Detection:** Listens for vocal distress and triggers SMS alerts.
- 🚶♂️ **Gait Instability & Fall Risk Prediction :** Analyzes motion patterns to predict and prevent falls.

Built with TensorFlow Lite, Arduino, and Flutter. A proactive assistive device for enhanced safety and independence.
